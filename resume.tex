\datedsubsection{\textbf{Nuro Inc.}}{Mountain View, CA}
\datedsubsection{\textit{Senior Software Engineer, Perception} | Python, C++}{Jun. 2024 - Present}
Develop state-of-the-art perception models \& implement associated train/deploy infrasturcture
\begin{itemize}
  \item Perform in-training and post-training profiling to identify the latency/memory/tech-debt bottlenecks
  \item Reduced \textbf{10\%} latency by re-modeling the anchor-based design with heatmap-based design and re-implementing corresponding custom dynamic ops with native static ops
  \item For custom ops that can't be replaced, implemented their FP16 counterparts to achieve \textbf{2x speedup}
  \item Optimized \textbf{20\%} memory with attention-based detection model to fully exploit the feature sparsity 
  \item Re-developed detection model with basic tf/keras3/torch ops, meanwhile ensuring the whole model's numerical \& speed parity across backends, as part of the team effort to move away from tensorflow towards pytorch
\end{itemize}

\datedsubsection{\textit{Software Engineer, Perception} | Python, C++}{Jan. 2021 - Jun. 2024}
Develop modernized perception modeling infrastructure
\begin{itemize}
  \item Developed keras-based \href{https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection3d}{\underline{MMDet}}-like framework that \textbf{unified the modeling workflow for perception team}
  \item Implemented unified TF-TRT custom operator API that supports automatic \href{https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/tensorrt/operators/docs/PluginV2.html}{\underline{TensorRT}} export with \href{https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/create_op}{\underline{custom TF ops}}
  \item Re-implemented the entire camera-lidar 3D detection workflow (from data generation, model training to final deployment) with frameworks above to showcase its better performance (\textbf{significantly improved APs} with joint temporal training) and debuggability (ultimately getting \textbf{5x higher hours per interruption} without NaN / OOM, etc.)
\end{itemize}

\datedsubsection{\textit{Research Intern (San Jose Office)} | C++, Bash, Python}{May. 2020 - Aug. 2020}
Compression and quantization of neural networks for camera-related CV tasks on smartphones
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{50\%} channel-pruning compression of CNN to obtain fine-grained quad bayer captured by \href{https://www.sony-semicon.co.jp/e/products/IS/mobile/2_2_ocl.html}{\underline{2x2 on-chip lens}}), enhanced the light-weight model (Python) for low-exposure frames with hard example fine-tuning
  \item \textbf{5x speedup} of CNN for bayer demosaicking on Xiaomi phone's raw data, achieved by mixed-bitwidth (16-bit activation and 8-bit weight) quantization-aware training (Python) with AIMET toolbox

Performance optimization and pipeline automation for deep learning frameworks and packages
\begin{itemize}
  \item Developed \href{https://github.com/ModelTC/NART}{\underline{pytorch-onnx-caffe conversion and profiling package}} supporting \textbf{all neural network layers}, effectively bridged the gap between research teams (training) and engineering teams (deployment) 
  \item Designed easy-to-use, modularized APIs that successfully worked with models within a wide variety such as pedestrian re-ID, face verification, car detection, etc. (number of users soon \textbf{exceeded 300} since first release in a month)
  \item Implemented novel neural network layers (time-shift operation, correlation convolution, etc.) in Caffe (C++) with research teams, \textbf{halved the train-test-deploy response cycle of any new model} 
  \item Developed inference framework (C) optimized for x86 processors with MKL-DNN, \textbf{2x speedup} compared to regular Caffe, used as deployment framework on development boards and light-weight chips
