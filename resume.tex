\datedsubsection{\textbf{SenseBrain Technology LLC}}{San Jose, CA}
\datedsubsection{\textit{Research Intern} | C++, Bash, Python}{May. 2020 - Aug. 2020}
Compression and quantization of neural networks for camera-related CV tasks on smartphones
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{50\%} channel-pruning compression of CNN to obtain fine-grained quad bayer captured by 2x2 on-chip lens (\href{https://www.sony-semicon.co.jp/e/products/IS/mobile/2_2_ocl.html}{\faExternalLink\ \textbf{product-link}}), enhanced the light-weight model (Python) for low-exposure frames with hard example fine-tuning
  \item \textbf{5x speedup} of CNN for bayer demosaicking on Xiaomi phone's raw data, achieved by mixed-bitwidth (16-bit activation and 8-bit weight) quantization-aware training (Python) with AIMET toolbox
  \item Developed the deployment pipeline for CNN models on smartphones (C++ and bash scripts), verified the model performance on the \textbf{DSP/CPU} of an Oppo Reno 2 and a google Pixel 3 with SNPE toolchain
\end{itemize}

\datedsubsection{\textbf{SenseTime Co., Ltd.}}{Beijing, China}
\datedsubsection{\textit{Research Intern} | C, C++, Python}{Feb. 2018 - Jul. 2019}
Performance optimization and pipeline automation for deep learning frameworks and packages
\begin{itemize}
  \item Developed pytorch-onnx-caffe conversion and profiling package (Python) supporting \textbf{all neural network layers}, effectively bridged the gap between research teams (training) and engineering teams (deployment) 
  \item Designed easy-to-use, modularized APIs that successfully worked with models within a wide variety such as pedestrian re-ID, face verification, car detection, etc. (number of users soon \textbf{exceeded 300} since first release in a month)
  \item Implemented novel neural network layers (time-shift operation, correlation convolution, etc.) in Caffe (C++) with research teams, \textbf{halved the train-test-deploy response cycle of any new model} 
  \item Developed inference framework (C) optimized for x86 processors with MKL-DNN, \textbf{2x speedup} compared to regular Caffe, used as deployment framework on development boards and light-weight chips
\end{itemize}
